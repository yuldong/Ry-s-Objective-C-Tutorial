**该教程是学习[Objective-C](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html)编程语言的地方,对这门语言的新人来说,该教程不仅提供了一个简明的快速相关(概念)查询,也有一个(对这些概念)综合的介绍.(当然,学习该教程)最好有一定的编程概念(基础),比如熟悉变量、函数、对象等,但这并不是严格要求的.**

*注: 以下是对该教程的一些评价*

Your tutorial was a great read and clarified a lot of concepts – especially on properties and memory management.    —George L.

Thank you very much for the tutorial on Objective-C. I have never seen such a thorough, detailed, comprehensive, and yet concise Objective-C tutorial!    —Mulugeta

This is the best tutorial of any kind that I have ever read. It is very well organized, clearly written and addresses the real impediments to learning. My compliments and thanks for saving me hours of experimentation.    —Stephen S.

Just wanted to let you know that your tutorial that I went through on Objective-C was BY FAR the best resource I have found. Normally I would never take the time to learn a new language as I am busy learning ASP.NET 4 in C# for my job, but this resource really inspired me to pick up Objective-C and begin working with Xcode.    —Miles E.
